    <div class="subtitle">A policy-driven expense platform built on Findity's white-label framework for US mid-market finance teams. Card-agnostic, but designed to favor our cards. UX and workflows first.</div>

  <!-- SLIDE 2: DESIGN PRINCIPLES (salmon) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF1E5">
    <div class="section-label">What We Believe</div>
    <h2>Four principles that shape every decision</h2>
    <div class="func-grid">
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Principle 01</div>
        <h3>Our Card First, Any Card Accepted</h3>
        <p>We issue T&amp;E cards through US Bank (primary) and FNBO (backup). Every UX nudge and workflow favors our card. But the system is card-agnostic — employees using their own cards pay per active user per month; our card is free with committed spend.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Principle 02</div>
        <h3>Policy at the Center</h3>
        <p>Rules are not bolted on after the fact. They shape the interface the employee sees, the options available to them, and the approval routing that follows.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Principle 03</div>
        <h3>Built on Findity, Not from Scratch</h3>
        <p>Findity's white-label T&amp;E platform is purpose-built for this. We bring the UX, workflows, card partnerships, and Centime integration. They bring the expense engine. Mid-market pragmatism: 200 to 2,000 employees without enterprise configuration overhead.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Principle 04</div>
        <h3>Accountability Without Friction</h3>
        <p>Capture what finance needs for audit and GL coding without making employees hate the process. The system should feel helpful, not punitive.</p>

  <!-- SLIDE 3: THREE PERSONAS (paper) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF7EF" class="slide-paper">
    <div class="section-label">Who We're Building For</div>
    <h2>Three personas, three sets of needs</h2>
    <div class="persona-grid">
      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>Employee</h3>
        <p>The submitter. Road warriors, occasional travelers, department leads making purchases. They need to submit expenses quickly with minimal data entry, understand what policy covers before spending, and know the status of every pending reimbursement. Corporate card transactions should flow in automatically so they never retype what the bank already knows.</p>
        <p class="persona-quote">"I don't know what I'm allowed to spend, and I submitted two weeks ago with no idea where it is."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>Manager</h3>
        <p>The approver. Direct managers, department heads, project leads in the approval chain. They need to review and approve from mobile, see policy violations flagged without reading every line item, and delegate authority when out of office.</p>
        <p class="persona-quote">"I get a pile of expense reports at month-end and can't tell which ones actually need my attention."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>Finance</h3>
        <p>The controller and reimburser. AP team, finance managers, controllers who close the books and reconcile cards. They need consistent policy enforcement, clean card reconciliation, proper GL coding, audit trails, and visibility into spend patterns and compliance rates across the organization.</p>
        <p class="persona-quote">"Half the card transactions are unmatched and I spend hours fixing GL codes employees picked wrong."</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 4: POLICY ENGINE (dark) -->
  <section data-background-color="#1A1817" class="slide-dark">
    <div class="section-label">The Backbone</div>
    <h2>The policy engine shapes everything</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;">Policies are not validation rules bolted onto a form. They are the system's central nervous system, shaping what employees see, what options are available, how approvals route, and how violations are handled. The engine evaluates a layered hierarchy where specificity wins:</p>
    <div class="hierarchy-block">
      <strong>Company Default</strong> — the baseline rules every employee inherits<br>
      <div class="level"><strong>Department / Division Override</strong> — sales may have different meal limits than engineering</div>
      <div class="level-2"><strong>Role-Based Override</strong> — executives or field sales get expanded thresholds</div>
      <div class="level-3"><strong>Project / Event Override</strong> — temporary rules for a conference or client engagement</div>
    </div>
    <p class="body">Employees should never have to guess. The system surfaces applicable policies before a trip, during submission with real-time validation, and in rejection messages tied to specific named rules rather than generic manager feedback. Violations are handled with three configurable responses: soft warnings the employee can override, hard warnings requiring justification, and hard blocks that prevent submission entirely.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 5: CORPORATE CARD MANDATE (salmon) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF1E5">
    <div class="section-label">Enforcing the Default</div>
    <h2>Four levels of corporate card mandate</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;">The system provides graduated enforcement for our Centime-issued cards (US Bank / FNBO). Each expense category can be assigned its own level. Employees using their own cards are always accepted but pay per active user per month. The recommended default is Level 2 company-wide, escalating to Level 3 for T&amp;E categories above $50.</p>
    <div class="func-grid">
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Level 1 · Encouraged</div>
        <h3>Gentle Reminder</h3>
        <p>Personal card is accepted. The employee sees a reminder that corporate card is preferred, but no justification is required and no friction is added to the submission.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Level 2 · Preferred</div>
        <h3>Justify the Exception</h3>
        <p>Personal card is accepted but requires a written justification: forgot card, vendor didn't accept, etc. The justification is visible to both the approver and finance for review.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Level 3 · Required</div>
        <h3>Block with Exception Path</h3>
        <p>Personal card submission is blocked for this category. The employee must use their corporate card or submit a policy exception request that routes to finance for pre-approval.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Level 4 · Mandatory</div>
        <h3>Auto-Reject</h3>
        <p>Personal card expenses in this category are automatically rejected with a message directing the employee to use their corporate card. No exception path without a finance override.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 6: T&E CORE FLOW (paper) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF7EF" class="slide-paper">
    <div class="section-label">T&amp;E Expenses</div>
    <h2>The core flow: card to reconciliation</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;">The primary path begins when a corporate card transaction posts. The system auto-matches to a merchant category code, pre-populates an expense line, and drops it into the employee's queue within 24 hours. The employee reviews, attaches a receipt, confirms the GL and project code, and submits. If the expense is within policy, below the auto-approval threshold, and has a receipt attached, it can be auto-approved and flow straight to finance reconciliation.</p>
    <div class="flow-chain">
      <div class="flow-step"><span class="flow-arrow">1.</span> Card transaction posts and auto-categorizes via MCC</div>
      <div class="flow-step"><span class="flow-arrow">2.</span> Pre-populated expense appears in employee queue</div>
      <div class="flow-step"><span class="flow-arrow">3.</span> Employee reviews, attaches receipt, confirms coding</div>
      <div class="flow-step"><span class="flow-arrow">4.</span> Auto-approved if in-policy, or routed to manager</div>
      <div class="flow-step"><span class="flow-arrow">5.</span> Finance reconciles card statement against approved expenses</div>
    </div>
    <p class="body">The personal card exception path always requires a receipt regardless of amount, justification for not using the corporate card, and routes through the standard approval chain before entering the reimbursement queue. Expenses can be submitted individually in real-time, grouped into trip-based reports, or batched monthly.</p>

  <!-- SLIDE 7: RECEIPT & MILEAGE (salmon) -->

  <!-- SLIDE 8: BASIC PURCHASING (dark) -->
  <section data-background-color="#1A1817" class="slide-dark">
    <div class="section-label">Lightweight P2P</div>
    <h2>Basic purchasing: control without overhead</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;">This module handles pre-approved purchases that do not go through a formal procurement system. It covers office supplies, software subscriptions, professional services, conference registrations, and team events below a company-configurable threshold. Capital expenditures, multi-year contracts, and inventory purchasing are explicitly out of scope. The goal is control and accountability, not full procure-to-pay.</p>
    <div class="flow-chain">

      <div class="flow-step"><span class="flow-arrow">6.</span> Three-way match closes the loop: request, approval, card transaction</div>
    </div>
    <p class="body">Purchases made without a prior request are flagged as unplanned spend. They still process through the system, but they surface in compliance reporting so finance can see patterns and address them.</p>

  <!-- SLIDE 9: APPROVAL WORKFLOWS (salmon) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF1E5">
    <div class="section-label">Workflow Engine</div>
    <h2>Approval routing that adapts to context</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;">Approval routing is configurable by amount threshold, expense category, policy violation status, and department. A $200 meal routes to the direct manager. A $3,000 software purchase routes to the director and then finance. Any policy violation can add an extra approver to the chain automatically.</p>

        <h3>Approve, Reject, Return, Modify</h3>
        <p>Approvers can approve, reject with a policy-linked reason, return for correction without restarting the process, or approve with a modified GL code or cost center while preserving the full audit trail.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Auto-Approval</div>
        <h3>When Everything Is Clean</h3>
        <p>Expenses within policy, on corporate card with receipt attached, correctly categorized, below the auto-approval threshold, and from an employee with no active violations can skip the queue. They still appear in the manager's dashboard for visibility.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Delegation</div>
        <h3>Vacation Coverage</h3>
        <p>An approver delegates to a named alternate for a defined date range. When they return, authority reverts automatically. No approvals should sit orphaned because someone is out of office.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Escalation</div>
        <h3>Aging Protection</h3>
        <p>Expenses pending approval beyond a configurable number of days auto-escalate to the next level in the chain. Batch approval lets managers select multiple compliant expenses and approve in a single action.</p>

  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 10: FINANCE OPERATIONS (paper) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF7EF" class="slide-paper">
    <div class="section-label">Finance Workspace</div>
    <h2>Reconciliation, reimbursement, and GL coding</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;">The reconciliation workspace gives finance a single view of every corporate card transaction: matched to an approved expense, submitted and pending approval, unsubmitted and aging, disputed by the employee, or flagged as a personal charge with repayment tracked. At period close, the system sends automated reminders at T-5, T-3, T-1, and deadline, then escalates unsubmitted transactions to managers.</p>
    <div class="pillar-grid">
      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>Reimbursement</h3>
        <p>Approved personal-card expenses enter a reimbursement queue. Finance runs batches on a configurable schedule, approves the batch, and pays via ACH, payroll integration, or check. Employees see real-time status from approved through processing to paid, with an expected payment date.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>GL Coding</h3>
        <p>MCC-to-GL auto-mapping with company-configurable rules. Single expenses can be split across multiple cost centers or projects. Invalid GL combinations are blocked at submission. Period assignment supports accrual accounting by separating the period incurred from the period submitted.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>Reporting</h3>
        <p>Policy compliance scorecards, corporate-vs-personal card ratios, unreconciled aging by bucket, spend by category against budget, approval cycle time, top spenders with trend lines, duplicate detection, and full audit trail exports. Everything finance needs to close the books.</p>

        <h3>SOC 2 and PCI</h3>
        <p>SOC 2 Type II required for mid-market enterprise sales. PCI compliance maintained by never storing card numbers — transaction data arrives via tokenized feeds. Receipts encrypted at rest with access-controlled, tamper-evident storage. Configurable retention policies per document type.</p>

    <h2>Four phases from MVP to full platform</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Built on Findity's white-label platform, our first objective is to deliver the UX and workflows. We ship the core expense workflow first on the Findity engine, then expand outward. Travel management is explicitly deprioritized — we will not compete with Navan.</p>
    <div class="cadence-row">
      <div class="cadence-item">
        <h4>Phase 1 · MVP</h4>
        <p>UX and workflows on Findity. Expense submission, Visa/MC real-time feeds from US Bank, basic policies, and approval workflows. The core loop from card swipe to finance reconciliation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="cadence-item">
        <h4>Phase 2 · +4 Weeks</h4>
        <p>Card-agnostic personal card flow, reimbursement processing, the advanced policy engine with full hierarchy, and mobile app for employees and managers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="cadence-row">
      <div class="cadence-item">
        <h4>Phase 3 · +8 Weeks</h4>
        <p>Basic purchasing module with purchase-to-card matching, three-way match, and unplanned spend flagging.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="cadence-item">
        <h4>Phase 4 · +12 Weeks</h4>
        <p>Advanced reporting and dashboards, FNBO backup card program integration, expanded ERP connectors.</p>

        <span><strong>Platform:</strong> Findity white-label. <strong>Market:</strong> US only. <strong>Card partners:</strong> US Bank (primary), FNBO (backup). <strong>Pricing:</strong> Free with our card + committed spend; per active user/month for own card.</span>

        <span class="q-num" style="color: var(--ft-wheat); opacity: 0.5;">&#10003;</span>
        <span><strong>Travel:</strong> Deprioritized — won't compete with Navan. <strong>Budget:</strong> No budget module — out of scope. <strong>Centime integration:</strong> GL/ERP is the connection point, nothing more. <strong>Card management:</strong> US Bank provides their own interface to clients directly.</span>

      <li>
        <span class="q-num" style="font-size: 1.3em;">?</span>
        <span><strong>Findity integration architecture.</strong> What is the boundary between our UX/workflow layer and Findity's engine? Where do we own the data model vs. consume theirs? How do we handle customization beyond Findity's configuration surface? <em>More to follow.</em></span>
