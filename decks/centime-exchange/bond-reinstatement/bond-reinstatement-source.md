**Re: Financial Institutions Bond B1230FC — Proposal for Reinstatement with Amended Coverage**

---

Dear HUB International Team,

We are writing to propose the reinstatement and amendment of Financial Institutions Bond B1230FC, previously underwritten by Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's on behalf of Centime, Inc.

Centime is a financial process automation company that provides mid-market finance teams with an integrated suite of solutions — accounts payable automation, accounts receivable automation, expense management, business banking, and cash flow forecasting — embedded directly within their ERP systems (NetSuite, Sage Intacct, QuickBooks, and Microsoft Dynamics).

On the payables side, Centime offers two complementary solutions: AP Automation (invoice-to-pay, covering invoice capture, coding, PO matching, approvals, and supplier management) and Payments Automation (integrated payables, covering payment execution via ACH, virtual card, and check, with reconciliation back to the ERP).

The coverage requested in this letter applies to payments made through either payables solution.

This letter provides context on the existing policy, the gap between what it covers and the risk we need to insure against, the competitive landscape that creates urgency for this coverage, and a specific proposal for amended terms. We recognize this is a more detailed submission than is typical for a reinstatement request, but the strategic context is important to understanding both the opportunity for the underwriter and the risk profile we bring to the table.

---

## 1. The Existing Policy: What It Covers

Bond B1230FC is a Financial Institutions Bond with a single insuring agreement covering Unauthorized Electronic Funds Transfer (UEFT). The key commercial terms as last quoted:

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Aggregate Limit** | USD 5,000,000 (bond period) |
| **Single Loss Limit** | USD 100,000 |
| **Deductible** | USD 10,000 per loss |
| **Annual Premium** | USD 30,000 minimum and deposit |
| **Scaling** | USD 90/client (301–400); USD 80/client (401–500) |
| **Insured Class** | Commercial account customers of Centime |
| **Territory** | Worldwide |

The insuring agreement covers loss resulting directly from an Insured having transferred, paid, or delivered any Money as the direct result of an Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer while using the Centime system as authorized for Check, ACH, or credit card payments.

The definition of "Unauthorized Electronic Funds Transfer" is specific: *an Electronic Funds Transfer from an Account initiated by a person other than the Insured without the actual authority to initiate the transfer and from which the Insured receives no benefit, and which arises out of a failure or violation of the security of an Insured's Computer System.*

This is a system-breach coverage. It covers the scenario in which a bad actor compromises a customer's computer system, gains unauthorized access to the Centime platform, and initiates a fraudulent payment. The customer did not authorize the transfer. The transfer arose from a security failure of the customer's systems.

The policy performed exactly as designed. During the period it was in force, Centime had zero claims. The controls embedded in our platform — multi-factor authentication, role-based access, payment approval workflows — prevented the covered loss scenario from occurring.

---

## 2. The Gap: What the Policy Does Not Cover

The fastest-growing category of B2B payment fraud is not system breach. It is supplier impersonation and business email compromise (BEC).

In these scenarios, no system is breached. No unauthorized access occurs. Instead, a bad actor impersonates a legitimate supplier — or compromises a supplier's email account — and submits fraudulent banking information to the buyer. The buyer, acting in good faith on what it believes is verified supplier data, initiates a payment to the wrong account. The buyer authorized the transfer. They were simply deceived about the destination.

This is the fraud vector that the current bond explicitly does not cover. The UEFT definition requires that the transfer be "initiated by a person other than the Insured without the actual authority" and that it "arise out of a failure or violation of the security of an Insured's Computer System." In a BEC/vendor impersonation scenario, neither condition is met. The Insured initiated the transfer with full authority. The Insured's computer system was not compromised.

### The scale of the problem

Business email compromise is the single largest category of cybercrime loss in the United States. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has consistently reported BEC losses exceeding $2.7 billion annually, dwarfing ransomware, data breaches, and traditional wire fraud combined. The median BEC loss for a mid-market company is approximately $50,000–$125,000 per incident, with tail events reaching seven figures.

The reason is structural: traditional AP processes rely on supplier-provided banking information that is verified through manual processes — voided checks, email confirmations, phone callbacks to numbers the supplier provided. These controls are routinely defeated by sophisticated social engineering. The buyer's AP team believes it has verified the account. It has not.

This is the risk our platform is specifically designed to mitigate, and the risk we need insurance to backstop.

---

## 3. What Has Changed Since the Original Bond

Since the bond lapsed, Centime has developed and deployed a capability called Centime Exchange, which is a supplier enrollment and verification platform that fundamentally changes the risk profile for the fraud vector described above.

### Centime Exchange — Supplier Verification Layer

Exchange is a supplier onboarding and management platform that serves as the verification layer for Centime's payables solutions — both AP Automation and Payments Automation. Before a supplier can receive any payment through the Centime platform, it must complete Exchange verification. The key controls include:

**Real-Time Bank Account Ownership Verification (CAS)**

Our proprietary Centime Account Services (CAS) technology verifies bank account ownership in real time through browser-based bank authentication. The supplier logs into their own bank account through a secure session, and we confirm that the account number provided matches an account to which the supplier has authenticated access. This is not a micro-deposit. It is not a third-party database lookup. It is real-time proof of ownership. A fraudster impersonating a supplier cannot pass this verification unless they have login access to the account they are claiming as their own.

**Comprehensive Document Collection and Verification**

Exchange collects and validates supplier documentation across three tiers of increasing scrutiny: Micro/Individual suppliers (W-9, basic business verification), Domestic Business suppliers (W-9, Articles of Incorporation, Certificate of Good Standing, insurance certificates with automated parsing and expiration tracking), and International suppliers (W-8 series, SWIFT/IBAN validation, local-language interface). Industry-specific document groups add construction, healthcare, IT, food service, and transportation compliance requirements.

**KYB and Compliance Screening**

Through our integration with Middesk, Exchange can perform Secretary of State verification, TIN validation, sanctions screening, PEP checks, and adverse media monitoring. These are available per-supplier and can be made mandatory at any verification tier.

**Configurable Outreach and Enrollment Campaigns**

Exchange does not wait passively for suppliers to register. It runs automated outreach campaigns with configurable follow-up sequences, deadline-driven enrollment windows, and real-time completion tracking. This drives enrollment velocity — the percentage of a buyer's supplier base that has been verified — which directly correlates to the percentage of payments flowing to verified accounts.

**Mobile-Responsive Supplier Portal**

Suppliers complete registration, upload documents, and manage their profiles from any device. This is critical for micro suppliers and sole proprietors who do not sit at desktops. Mobile access increases completion rates, which increases verification coverage, which reduces the residual unverified population.

**The net effect:** when a payment is made through the Centime platform to an Exchange-verified supplier, the bank account receiving that payment has been proven to belong to the supplier through real-time ownership verification. The primary attack vector for BEC/vendor impersonation fraud — substituting a fraudulent bank account for a legitimate one — is closed.

This is a materially stronger risk posture than existed when the original bond was written. The original bond covered system breach risk with platform-level access controls. We are now asking to extend coverage to supplier impersonation risk with a dedicated verification infrastructure that did not exist at the time of original underwriting.

---

## 4. Why This Coverage Matters: Competitive Context

We are not requesting this coverage solely as a risk transfer mechanism. Fraud indemnification has become a competitive requirement in the B2B payments market, and the absence of it is becoming a meaningful barrier to new customer acquisition.

### PaymentWorks: The benchmark

PaymentWorks is a supplier onboarding platform that has been in market since 2013. They serve approximately 200 customers, primarily in higher education and public sector, with estimated annual revenue of $12M. Their marquee relationship is with J.P. Morgan.

PaymentWorks' primary competitive differentiator is not their software. It is their fraud indemnification. They offer coverage of up to $2 million per fraudulent payment, included automatically in every customer contract. No separate purchase decision. No opt-in. It is bundled.

Their sales motion leads with this. In competitive evaluations, particularly with procurement committees and risk-conscious finance teams, the indemnification is frequently the deciding factor. The software capabilities — supplier onboarding, document collection, bank account validation — are table stakes. The insurance is the close.

PaymentWorks' fraud indemnification is underwritten by a specialty insurer (understood to be distributed through their platform fee, not purchased separately by the buyer). Their zero-claims record and verification controls are the underwriting foundation.

### Tier 2 AP Platforms: No indemnification

The larger AP automation platforms — Tipalti ($300M+ revenue), BILL (public, ~$1.3B revenue), Stampli (~$60M revenue), AvidXchange (public, ~$400M revenue) — process significantly more payment volume than PaymentWorks. None of them offer fraud indemnification on supplier verification. They have basic vendor management features, but none have invested in the verification depth required to underwrite the risk.

This creates a specific competitive opportunity for Centime: we can offer PaymentWorks-caliber indemnification with a full-lifecycle payables platform — spanning invoice capture through payment execution and reconciliation — that none of the Tier 2 competitors can match. Exchange gives us the verification foundation. Our payables solutions give us the transaction layer. The combination is unique in the market.

### Centime's distribution model

Centime distributes through bank partnerships. We currently partner with six banks, including M&T Bank, City National, and First National Bank of Omaha, with additional partnerships in active development. Banks white-label Centime's payables platform and offer it to their commercial banking clients. This distribution channel will grow meaningfully in the months and years ahead as we expand our bank partner network.

Bank partners are highly receptive to fraud indemnification as a differentiator. It strengthens their commercial banking relationship, reduces the risk of payment fraud flowing through their rails, and gives their relationship managers a concrete value proposition when presenting AP automation to commercial clients.

No Tier 2 AP platform distributes through bank channels. This is a structural advantage for Centime, and fraud indemnification makes the bank channel pitch significantly stronger.

---

## 5. Our Proposal

We are requesting reinstatement of Bond B1230FC with the following amendments:

### 5a. Amended insuring agreement

We propose adding a second insuring agreement — Insuring Agreement (B) — to cover loss resulting from Social Engineering and Vendor Impersonation fraud. This would sit alongside the existing Insuring Agreement (A) for Unauthorized Electronic Funds Transfer.

The new insuring agreement would cover:

- Loss resulting directly from an Insured having transferred, paid, or delivered any Money to a person, account, or entity that is not the intended recipient, where such transfer was induced by fraudulent instruction, fraudulent impersonation of a supplier, or fraudulent alteration of banking or payment routing information

- Provided that the payment was made through the Centime platform (via either AP Automation or Payments Automation) to a supplier that had been enrolled and verified through the Centime Exchange platform at the time of the transfer

The critical underwriting control is the proviso: coverage applies only to payments made to Exchange-verified suppliers. This means every covered payment has gone through real-time bank account ownership verification (CAS), document collection and validation, and any applicable KYB/compliance screening. The underwriter's exposure is limited to the population of payments where Centime's full verification stack has been applied.

Payments to suppliers who have not completed Exchange verification would not be covered under Agreement (B). This gives the underwriter a clear, binary trigger: verified = covered; unverified = not covered. It also incentivizes Centime to drive enrollment velocity, which further reduces residual risk over time.

### 5b. Proposed limits

| | Agreement (A): UEFT | Agreement (B): Social Engineering |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| **Aggregate Limit** | USD 5,000,000 | USD 5,000,000 |
| **Single Loss Limit** | USD 100,000 | USD 500,000 |
| **Deductible** | USD 10,000 | USD 25,000 |

We recognize that Agreement (B) represents a different risk profile than Agreement (A) and have proposed a higher single loss limit ($500,000 vs. $100,000) with a correspondingly higher deductible ($25,000 vs. $10,000) to reflect both the typical loss severity for vendor impersonation incidents and Centime's willingness to retain meaningful first-dollar exposure.

We are open to discussion on these figures. Our competitive requirement is a single loss limit that is credible in the market — high enough to be meaningful in sales conversations with mid-market finance teams. The $500,000 figure is our starting position; we would welcome the underwriter's perspective on the appropriate limit given the Exchange verification controls described above.

### 5c. Premium and funding structure: Master facility with per-customer premium

We are proposing a structure in which Centime acts as the distribution channel for a master insurance facility, rather than purchasing a traditional lump-sum annual policy.

**How this would work:**

Centime and the underwriter agree on a master facility that covers all Centime payables customers — whether using AP Automation, Payments Automation, or both — who meet the Exchange verification requirements. The premium is calculated on a per-customer basis and scales automatically as Centime's customer base grows. Centime collects the per-customer premium through its platform billing — either as a visible line item or embedded in the platform fee — and remits to the underwriter on an agreed schedule (monthly or quarterly).

This structure achieves several objectives for both parties:

- **No lump-sum premium outlay.** Centime does not front the cost of the policy. Premium is funded by the customers it covers, collected through existing billing infrastructure, and remitted to the underwriter. The premium is self-funding from day one.

- **Predictable, growing premium stream for the underwriter.** The underwriter receives per-customer premium that grows automatically as Centime adds customers and bank partners. Centime currently serves 150+ customers across six bank partnerships, including M&T Bank and City National, with additional partnerships in active development. We project reaching 250+ customers by end of 2026. Every new customer represents incremental premium.

- **Automatic enrollment, no adverse selection.** Every payables customer is enrolled automatically. There is no opt-in decision, which eliminates adverse selection risk — the underwriter is insuring the full pool, not just the customers who perceive themselves as high-risk.

- **Alignment of incentives.** Centime is incentivized to drive Exchange enrollment velocity (more verified suppliers = more covered payments = stronger value proposition), which simultaneously reduces the underwriter's residual risk exposure. The per-customer model means Centime only incurs premium cost where it has revenue to support it.

**Illustrative economics (for discussion, not a binding proposal):**

| Metric | Current | End of 2026 (projected) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Payables Customers | 150+ | 250+ |
| Per-customer annual premium (illustrative) | $150–$300 | $150–$300 |
| Total annual premium to underwriter | $22,500–$45,000 | $37,500–$75,000 |
| Bank partners | 6 | 8–10 |

These figures are illustrative. We are open to the underwriter's view on appropriate per-customer pricing given the Exchange verification controls, the binary coverage trigger, and the zero-claims history. What matters to us is the structure: per-customer, collected through platform billing, remitted on a predictable schedule, and scaling with the business.

**Optional: Tiered coverage or customer-elected upgrades.** We are also open to discussing a base coverage tier that is included for all customers (for example, $250,000 per incident) with an optional upgrade tier available for purchase (for example, $500,000 or $1,000,000 per incident at additional per-customer premium). This would give the underwriter flexibility to price the base layer conservatively while offering higher limits to customers who want them, and would give Centime additional margin opportunity on the upgrade tier.

We recognize this is a conversation about finding the right structure, not a take-it-or-leave-it proposal. Our objective is a funding model where the premium is self-sustaining through customer revenue, the underwriter receives a growing and predictable premium stream, and every Centime customer benefits from fraud indemnification as a standard feature of the platform.

### 5d. Underwriting information we can provide

We are prepared to furnish the following to support the underwriter's assessment:

1. Updated application with current business profile, customer count, transaction volume, and payment processing figures

2. Technical documentation on Exchange verification controls, including CAS bank account ownership verification, document management workflows, and KYB/compliance screening processes

3. Claims history confirmation (zero claims during prior bond period)

4. Enrollment velocity data showing the percentage of each customer's supplier base that has completed Exchange verification

5. Platform security documentation, including SOC 2 compliance status, multi-factor authentication requirements, and role-based access controls

6. Bank partnership documentation demonstrating the institutional distribution channel and the regulatory environment in which Centime operates

7. Sample Exchange verification workflow showing the end-to-end supplier journey from initial outreach through bank account verification and document collection

---

## 6. The Underwriter's Perspective

We want to be direct about why we believe this is an attractive risk for the underwriter, not just a good outcome for Centime.

**The verification controls are superior to market standard.** Most B2B payment platforms rely on third-party database lookups, micro-deposits, or manual document review to verify supplier banking information. These methods are either slow (micro-deposits take 2–3 days and can be intercepted), passive (database lookups check against stale records), or human-dependent (manual review introduces error and inconsistency). Centime's CAS technology performs real-time bank account ownership verification through direct bank authentication. This is a fundamentally stronger control than anything else in market, and it is the foundation of every Exchange-verified supplier record.

**The coverage trigger is binary and auditable.** A supplier is either Exchange-verified or it is not. This is not a subjective standard. It is a system state that is timestamped, logged, and auditable. The underwriter can define minimum verification requirements (for example, CAS completion must be no older than 12 months; W-9 must be on file; etc.) and Centime can enforce them programmatically. This gives the underwriter bright-line control over what qualifies for coverage.

**The premium model is self-funding with no adverse selection.** The per-customer premium structure means every payables customer contributes to the premium pool automatically — there is no opt-in, which eliminates the adverse selection risk inherent in voluntary insurance programs. The underwriter's premium income grows as Centime's customer base grows, and the exposure grows proportionally. Centime collects and remits on a predictable schedule, creating a low-friction, growing revenue stream for the underwriter.

**The claims history is clean.** Centime has operated its payment platform since inception with zero fraudulent payment losses. The prior bond period produced zero claims. While past performance does not guarantee future results, it does demonstrate that Centime's platform controls and customer base represent a well-managed risk.

**The competitive precedent exists.** PaymentWorks has offered bundled fraud indemnification to its customer base for years, also through specialty insurance underwriting. Their model has proven commercially viable and, to our knowledge, has not produced significant claims activity. The market has established that B2B payment platform indemnification is an insurable risk when backed by appropriate verification controls. Centime's verification controls, particularly CAS, are more rigorous than PaymentWorks' validation methods.

## 7. Summary and Next Steps

| | |
|---|---|
| **What we have** | A fully underwritten Lloyd's Financial Institutions Bond (B1230FC) covering Unauthorized Electronic Funds Transfer through the Centime platform, with zero claims history and a premium model designed for scalable distribution. |
| **What we need** | Broadened coverage to include Social Engineering and Vendor Impersonation fraud, with a single loss limit of $500,000 per incident, applicable only to payments made to Exchange-verified suppliers. |
| **What's changed** | Since the original bond, Centime has built and deployed Exchange — a supplier enrollment and verification platform with real-time bank account ownership verification — which directly mitigates the fraud vector we are asking to insure against. |
| **Why it matters** | Fraud indemnification has become a competitive requirement in B2B payments. Our primary competitor bundles it. The Tier 2 platforms cannot offer it. This coverage, combined with our bank-channel distribution and full-lifecycle payables platform, creates a market position no competitor can replicate. |
| **What we're asking** | A conversation with the underwriting team to discuss amended terms. We are prepared to provide all documentation needed to support the assessment and are flexible on structure, limits, and premium within the framework described above. |

We would welcome the opportunity to schedule a call with the underwriting team to walk through the Exchange platform, demonstrate the CAS verification technology, and discuss the amended coverage in detail. We believe the combination of Centime's zero-claims history, the Exchange verification infrastructure, and the bundled distribution model presents an underwriting opportunity that is both well-controlled and commercially attractive.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
