# Why We Position Exchange the Way We Do

## The question we keep coming back to

Is Centime Exchange a product or a feature?

We've gone back and forth on this. The honest answer is that it's both, and the way we talk about it depends on who's in the room. But behind the scenes, we need to be precise about why we've landed where we've landed — because the positioning choices we make here affect pricing, packaging, sales motion, and how our bank partners present us.

This document is the reasoning. Not the pitch. The reasoning.

## What Centime is

Before we talk about Exchange, we need to be clear about the business we're in.

Centime is a **Financial Process Automation** platform. We automate the payables lifecycle for mid-market finance teams. The platform has two core solutions:

- **AP Automation (Invoice-to-Pay)** — invoice capture, coding, approval workflows, and posting. The front half of the payables lifecycle: everything from when an invoice arrives to when it's approved and ready for payment.
- **Payments Automation (Integrated Payables)** — payment execution across ACH, virtual card, check, and wire. The back half: everything from approved invoice to settled payment. This is where Integrated Payables (IP) lives.

Together, AP Automation and IP cover the full invoice-to-payment lifecycle. Exchange — supplier enrollment and verification — complements both. A supplier needs to be verified before you process their first invoice (AP) and before you execute their first payment (IP). Exchange is the layer that makes both solutions work better.

## The state of standalone supplier management

There is a category called "supplier onboarding" or "vendor management." It exists. Companies buy it. But it has never produced a breakout company.

PaymentWorks is the clearest example. Founded in 2013. Roughly $12M in annual revenue after twelve years. About 100 employees. Never raised a real growth round. They found a niche — higher-ed, public sector, enterprise compliance buyers — and they've stayed there. J.P. Morgan is their marquee partnership. They do one thing well: collect vendor data, validate it, and push it into an ERP. They've added fraud indemnification (up to $2M per payment) and early pay, but the core is still the same: clean up the vendor master file.

PaymentWorks is not failing. But PaymentWorks is not scaling, either.

The question is why. And the answer tells us everything about how to position Exchange.

### Why pure-play supplier onboarding hasn't broken out

Four reasons, all structural:

**Onboarding is a feature, not a destination.** Every AP automation platform eventually adds basic supplier onboarding. Tipalti has it. BILL has network effects that approximate it. Stampli launched Advanced Vendor Management. The moment onboarding becomes table stakes inside broader platforms, the standalone product loses its reason to exist as a separate purchase.

**The buyer doesn't wake up thinking about it.** A CFO or AP director opens their laptop thinking "I need to pay my vendors." They are not thinking "I need a supplier onboarding platform." Onboarding is a means to an end. The end is processing invoices and executing payments. If you sell the means without the end, you're always a secondary purchase — something that gets attached to the real platform, not something that replaces it.

**There's no lock-in.** Once you've onboarded your suppliers, what keeps you on the platform? The data has already moved to your ERP. The W-9s are filed. The bank accounts are verified. There's no ongoing transaction flow that makes switching painful. Compare that to a payables platform: invoices are flowing, POs are matched, payments are executing, suppliers are logging in to check remittance. That's lock-in. Onboarding alone doesn't create it.

**The network never materializes.** Every supplier onboarding platform pitches a network effect — "once a supplier registers with us, they're pre-verified for every buyer on the platform." In practice, this barely works. Every buyer has different document requirements, different compliance thresholds, different insurance minimums. A supplier's registration for a university in California doesn't transfer to a construction company in Texas. The customization kills the network.

These aren't problems PaymentWorks can solve by executing better. They're properties of the category.

## What this means for Exchange

Exchange has every capability that PaymentWorks has — and in most areas, more. Real-time bank account ownership verification (not micro-deposits). Configurable outreach campaigns (not a single email invite). Comprehensive document management with automated parsing, metadata extraction, and expiration tracking. Mobile-responsive supplier registration. Industry-specific document category groups. Tiered onboarding based on supplier complexity.

If we wanted to, we could go head-to-head with PaymentWorks as a standalone supplier management platform and win on features.

But we'd inherit all four structural problems.

We'd be selling a feature as a product. We'd be the secondary purchase. We'd have no transaction lock-in. And we'd be waiting for a network effect that never comes.

We'd be building a $12M company. We already know what that ceiling looks like because someone else spent twelve years finding it.

## The play: Exchange is what makes Centime's platform win

Centime's Financial Process Automation platform is the product. Exchange is what makes it better than every competing AP and payments solution on the market.

Here's the logic:

Every AP automation and payments platform — Tipalti, BILL, Stampli, AvidXchange — handles invoice processing and payment execution. Those are table stakes. The competitive differentiation has collapsed. They're all fighting over the same features: better OCR, faster approvals, more payment methods, slicker dashboards.

None of them have solved what happens *before* the first invoice. How does a supplier get into the system? How do you verify their bank account is real and belongs to them? How do you collect the right documents for the right supplier type? How do you run outreach campaigns to enroll suppliers who haven't registered yet? How do you track insurance expirations and flag compliance gaps?

That's Exchange. And it's the gap none of them are closing.

When we sell the Centime platform, the pitch isn't "we process invoices and execute payments" — every platform does that. The pitch is: "We're the only platform that starts before the first invoice and runs through the last payment. Your suppliers are verified, documented, and transaction-ready before a single dollar moves."

Exchange makes that pitch possible. Without Exchange, our AP and IP solutions are competitive but undifferentiated. With Exchange, Centime is the only financial process automation platform with a verified supplier enrollment layer that serves both the invoice side and the payment side.

### The revenue math confirms it

Standalone Exchange at $3,500 per year is a fine product. But the revenue compounds on the transaction layer — across both AP Automation and Integrated Payables:

- $3,500 base platform fee
- AP Automation subscription revenue
- Payment processing revenue (ACH, virtual card, check)
- Virtual card rebates back to the buyer
- Early Pay / dynamic discounting fees
- Document management and compliance add-ons
- Per-supplier Middesk reports

A fully realized Centime platform relationship — AP + IP + Exchange — generates $15K–$30K+ per customer annually. The enrollment fee is the front door. The invoice and payment transactions are the house.

This is why PaymentWorks is stuck at $12M. They have the front door but no house behind it.

### The bank channel proves it

Our distribution is through bank partners — FNBO, and others in the pipeline. Banks will not white-label a standalone supplier onboarding tool. There's no revenue in it for them, no transaction volume to report, no payment economics to share.

Banks *will* white-label a financial process automation platform that drives commercial payment volume through their rails. That's Centime: AP Automation + IP + Exchange. The supplier enrollment layer is what makes the platform defensible and the onboarding frictionless, but the invoice and payment volume is what makes the bank say yes.

No Tier 2 AP competitor — not Tipalti, not BILL, not Stampli — distributes through bank channels. They all sell direct. Our bank-channel distribution is a structural advantage, and it only works because we sell the full stack, not just the enrollment layer.

## So is Exchange a product or a feature?

It's a named capability of the Centime platform — with a standalone option for buyers who need it separately.

Think of it like Tipalti's "Detect" (fraud prevention) or "NetNow" (early pay). Those are named features that show up in marketing, but nobody buys Detect without buying Tipalti. They exist to make the platform story stronger, not to stand on their own.

Exchange works the same way:

**When we sell the Centime platform** — which is the primary motion — Exchange is included. It's the enrollment foundation that serves both AP Automation and Integrated Payables. The pitch is "Centime, powered by Exchange." One platform, one price, one contract. The buyer doesn't make a separate decision about Exchange. They get it.

**When someone only needs enrollment** — a buyer who already has Tipalti or NetSuite AP but wants verified supplier onboarding — Exchange is available standalone. This buyer exists. A bank partner might bring us this buyer. It's a real revenue opportunity and, more importantly, it's a foot in the door for an eventual platform upsell — starting with AP Automation or IP.

But we don't *lead* with standalone Exchange. We don't build a separate sales deck, a separate pricing page, a separate support tier. We don't create a second product that splits our team's attention.

Exchange has a name because the enrollment capability needs an identity that travels — in competitive conversations, in bank partner materials, in customer-facing documentation. Nameless features don't win competitive deals. But the name serves the platform sale. It doesn't compete with it.

## The fraud indemnification angle

One more piece that sharpens this positioning.

We have a lapsed insurance policy — a specialty umbrella that indemnified customers against loss from fraudulent payments to Exchange-verified suppliers. It lapsed because we couldn't justify the $30K annual premium when we had no mechanism to recover the cost.

The model that works: bundle indemnification into the base platform price. Raise the base fee $500–$800 per customer. Across 50+ platform customers, we recover the premium. The buyer never makes a buy/no-buy decision on indemnification — it's just a feature of the platform.

This is exactly how PaymentWorks does it. Their fraud indemnification (up to $2M per payment) is included automatically. It's not sold separately. It's the thing their sales team leads with, and it's the thing that makes procurement committees comfortable signing off.

If we resurrect this policy with bundled distribution and our zero-claims history, we can credibly say: "Every payment to an Exchange-verified supplier is indemnified up to $X." That's a sentence no Tier 2 AP competitor can match. Not Tipalti. Not BILL. Not Stampli. Not AvidXchange.

And it only works because Exchange verification is the underwriting foundation. The insurer's risk is lower when every supplier has gone through real-time bank account ownership proof, document verification, and compliance screening. The stronger the Exchange verification, the better the indemnification terms.

This creates a flywheel: better verification → lower insurance risk → higher indemnification limits → stronger competitive positioning → more platform sales → more suppliers on the Exchange → better verification data.

## How this translates to customer-facing materials

The material set follows the positioning:

**Centime Financial Process Automation** — the primary deck. This is where Exchange shows up as the enrollment foundation alongside AP Automation and Integrated Payables. Competitive analyses against Tipalti, BILL, Stampli lead with "we start before the first invoice." Exchange is woven throughout but the platform is the product being sold.

**Centime Exchange** — a lighter set. One-pager, maybe a short deck. For the standalone buyer or the bank partner who encounters a prospect that already has AP but needs enrollment. References the full Centime platform as the upgrade path but stands on its own.

**Internal competitive documents** — the detailed matrices and gap analyses we've already built. These inform the sales team about positioning against specific competitors but don't go directly to buyers.

The ratio should be roughly 80/20: eighty percent of our customer-facing materials are platform-led with Exchange as a featured capability; twenty percent are Exchange-standalone for the specific use case.

## The bottom line

We are not building a supplier onboarding company. The market has shown us the ceiling on that and it's not where we're going.

We are building a financial process automation company — AP Automation and Integrated Payables — with the best supplier enrollment layer in the market. Exchange is that layer. It's named, it's real, it's defensible, and it's the single biggest reason we win against platforms that are better funded and more established.

But the business is the platform. The revenue is in invoice processing and payment transactions. The distribution is through banks. And Exchange is the engine underneath all of it.

That's why we position it the way we position it.
