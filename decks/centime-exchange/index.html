  <!-- SLIDE 2: THE CORE QUESTION (salmon) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF1E5">
    <div class="section-label">The Question</div>
    <h2>Is Exchange a product or a feature?</h2>
    <p class="body">It's both, and the way we talk about it depends on who's in the room. But behind the scenes, we need to be precise &mdash; because positioning choices affect pricing, packaging, sales motion, and how our bank partners present us. This document lays out the reasoning so everyone on the team argues from the same set of facts.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 3: WHAT IS CENTIME (dark) -->
  <section data-background-color="#1A1817" class="slide-dark">
    <div class="section-label">The Platform</div>
    <h2>Centime is a Financial Process Automation platform</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;">Before we talk about Exchange, we need to be clear about what it plugs into. Centime is not a single product &mdash; it's a platform with two core solutions that cover the full procure-to-pay lifecycle.</p>
    <div class="func-grid">
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Solution 01</div>
        <h3>AP Automation (Invoice-to-Pay)</h3>
        <p>Invoice capture, coding, approval workflows, GL sync, and audit-ready records. This is where the daily work happens &mdash; the system of record for every invoice that enters the organization. Revenue is subscription-based: predictable, recurring, and tied to invoice volume.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Solution 02</div>
        <h3>Payments Automation (Integrated Payables)</h3>
        <p>Payment execution across virtual card, ACH, check, and cross-border rails. This is where the transaction economics live &mdash; rebates, processing fees, and float. Revenue is transaction-based: it scales with payment volume and mix.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="body" style="margin-top: 0.6em;">Exchange complements both. It sits upstream of AP Automation and Integrated Payables &mdash; ensuring that every supplier entering either system is verified, bankable, and compliant before the first invoice or payment is processed.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 4: PAYMENTWORKS CASE STUDY (paper) -->
  <!-- (was slide 3) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF7EF" class="slide-paper">
    <div class="section-label">The Cautionary Tale</div>
    <h2>Standalone supplier management has a ceiling</h2>
    <div class="func-grid">
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">PaymentWorks</div>
        <h3>The Facts</h3>
        <p>Founded 2013. Roughly $12M in revenue after twelve years. Around 100 employees. A J.P. Morgan partnership that validates the category but hasn't changed the growth curve. They do one thing &mdash; supplier onboarding and verification &mdash; and they do it well.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">The Lesson</div>
        <h3>Good Product, Small Market</h3>
        <p>PaymentWorks proves the capability matters. It also proves that selling supplier onboarding as a standalone product creates a low ceiling. The buyer values it, but not enough to build a large business around it. The category is real. The standalone economics are not.</p>

  <!-- SLIDE 5: FOUR STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS (dark) -->
  <section data-background-color="#1A1817" class="slide-dark">
    <div class="section-label">Why Pure-Play Doesn't Scale</div>
    <h2>Four structural problems we'd inherit</h2>
    <div class="func-grid">
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Problem 01</div>
        <h3>Onboarding is a feature, not a destination</h3>
        <p>Nobody logs in every morning to onboard suppliers. It's a task that happens when needed, not a daily workflow. Products that get used occasionally have weaker retention and lower willingness to pay.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Problem 02</div>
        <h3>The buyer doesn't wake up thinking about it</h3>
        <p>CFOs and AP leaders think about cash, payments, and reconciliation every day. Supplier onboarding surfaces when there's a problem &mdash; a new vendor, a compliance gap, a fraud scare. Reactive demand is harder to sell into than daily pain.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Problem 03</div>
        <h3>There's no lock-in</h3>
        <p>Supplier data is portable. If a competitor offers onboarding bundled with their AP platform, switching costs are low. There's no transaction stream, no network effect, no compounding data asset that makes leaving painful.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="func-item">
        <div class="func-num">Problem 04</div>
        <h3>The network never materializes</h3>
        <p>Every supplier management company pitches a network: "onboard once, share everywhere." It never works. Buyers want their own verification standards. Suppliers don't trust shared networks. The promised efficiency doesn't arrive.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 6: EXCHANGE CAPABILITIES (salmon) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF1E5">
    <div class="section-label">What We've Built</div>
    <h2>Exchange has everything PaymentWorks has &mdash; and more</h2>
    <p class="body">Real-time bank account ownership verification. Configurable outreach campaigns with automated follow-up. Comprehensive document management with automated parsing and expiration tracking. Mobile-responsive supplier registration that works without a login. Industry-specific document categories. Tiered onboarding workflows that scale from a quick bank verification to a full compliance package.</p>
    <p class="body" style="margin-top: 0.6em;">The capability is strong. The question was never whether we could compete with PaymentWorks on features. The question is whether we should compete with them on positioning. If we sold Exchange standalone, we'd inherit all four structural problems. So we don't.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 7: THE PLAY (dark) -->
  <section data-background-color="#1A1817" class="slide-dark">
    <div class="section-label">The Strategic Play</div>
    <h2>Exchange is what makes Centime's platform win</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;">Centime has two core solutions: AP Automation for processing invoices and Integrated Payables for executing payments. Every competitor has one or the other. None have solved what happens before the first invoice: verifying the supplier, collecting their banking details, confirming their tax and compliance documents, and creating a clean master record. That gap is where errors start, where fraud enters, and where both the AP and payment workflows break.</p>
    <p class="body">Exchange fills that gap for both solutions. It turns the Centime platform from "another AP automation tool" into something structurally different &mdash; a system that covers supplier verification, invoice processing, and payment execution end to end. The pitch writes itself: "We're the only platform that starts before the first invoice and runs through the last payment." That's not a tagline. That's an architectural advantage that no Tier 2 competitor can replicate without building what we've already built.</p>

  <!-- SLIDE 8: REVENUE MATH (salmon) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF1E5">
    <div class="section-label">The Economics</div>
    <h2>The front door vs. the house</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;">Exchange standalone might command $3,500 per year &mdash; a respectable SaaS contract but a small one. The value isn't in the subscription. It's in what Exchange unlocks downstream.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="body">PaymentWorks has the front door but no house behind it. We have the house. Exchange is the front door that gets people inside.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 9: AD VALOREM THESIS (paper) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF7EF" class="slide-paper">
    <div class="section-label">The Revenue Thesis</div>
    <h2>Exchange as the ad valorem accelerator</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;">A hypothesis we haven't fully proven but believe is directionally right: Exchange may be most valuable as a driver of ad valorem transactions &mdash; dynamic discounting and virtual card payments &mdash; where Centime earns a percentage of every dollar that moves. Exchange verifies suppliers, collects payment preferences, and confirms they're transaction-ready. That's the foundation for enrolling suppliers into early pay programs and virtual card acceptance from day one.</p>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;">This probably matters more for IP customers than AP customers. AP Automation generates subscription revenue regardless of payment method. But IP revenue is transaction-driven, and the highest-margin transactions are virtual card (rebate revenue) and dynamic discounting (discount share). Exchange is the enrollment engine that feeds those programs.</p>
    <p class="body" style="font-style: italic; color: var(--ft-slate);">We haven't proven this yet. The data will come as we scale. But if the thesis holds, Exchange isn't just a differentiator &mdash; it's the revenue accelerator for our highest-margin products.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 10: DISTRIBUTION (dark) -->
  <section data-background-color="#1A1817" class="slide-dark">
    <div class="section-label">Distribution</div>
    <h2>Direct and bank: Exchange strengthens both</h2>
    <div class="position-grid">
      <div class="position-col">
        <h3>Direct sales</h3>
        <p>Exchange is the differentiator that separates Centime in the demo. When a prospect evaluates Tipalti, BILL, Stampli, and Centime side by side, Exchange is what none of the others can match. "We start before the first invoice" is a positioning statement only Centime can make. It gets us on the shortlist and closes the deal.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="position-col">
        <h3>Bank-channel sales</h3>
        <p>Banks will not white-label standalone onboarding &mdash; the economics don't justify it. They will white-label a platform that drives commercial payment volume through their rails. Exchange makes the platform defensible and the onboarding frictionless; the payment volume is what makes the bank say yes.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="body" style="margin-top: 0.6em;">No Tier 2 AP competitor distributes through bank channels. Our dual distribution &mdash; direct where Exchange differentiates, bank where Exchange amplifies &mdash; is a structural advantage that compounds as we add partners.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 11: PRODUCT OR FEATURE? (salmon) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF1E5">
    <div class="section-label">The Answer</div>
    <h2>A named capability with a standalone option</h2>
    <div class="position-grid">
      <div class="position-col">
        <h3>When we sell the Centime platform</h3>
        <p>Exchange is included. One platform, one price, one contract. We don't itemize it, we don't charge separately, and we don't give the buyer a reason to think they can skip it. It's the supplier layer of the platform &mdash; the reason everything downstream in AP Automation and Integrated Payables works cleanly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="position-col">
        <h3>When someone only needs enrollment</h3>
        <p>Exchange is available standalone. Priced modestly. Positioned as a foot in the door. Every standalone Exchange customer is a future platform upsell &mdash; they've already onboarded their suppliers on our platform. The switching cost to the full Centime stack drops to near zero.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="body" style="margin-top: 0.6em;">The bottom line: we don't lead with standalone Exchange. We lead with the Centime platform and let Exchange be the differentiator that closes the deal. Standalone is the exception, not the strategy.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 12: FRAUD INDEMNIFICATION (paper) -->
  <section data-background-color="#FFF7EF" class="slide-paper">
    <div class="section-label">Worth Exploring</div>
    <h2>The fraud indemnification question</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;">We previously held a specialty insurance policy that indemnified customers against loss from fraudulent payments to Exchange-verified suppliers. It lapsed. PaymentWorks offers something similar &mdash; up to $2M per payment, bundled automatically &mdash; and it's what their sales team leads with.</p>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;">In theory, a model works: bundle indemnification into the platform price, raise the base fee modestly, recover the premium across the customer base. If the answers come back favorably, we could credibly say: <em>"Every payment to an Exchange-verified supplier is indemnified."</em> That's a sentence no Tier 2 competitor can match.</p>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;">But there are open questions. Can we underwrite this through Exchange specifically? Is the premium still viable? Do we have the claims infrastructure? Does our zero-claims history help us renegotiate?</p>
    <p class="body" style="font-style: italic; color: var(--ft-slate);">This is not part of our current positioning. It's worth investigating &mdash; it could sharpen our competitive story considerably if the economics and logistics work out.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SLIDE 13: MATERIALS STRATEGY (dark) -->
  <section data-background-color="#1A1817" class="slide-dark">
    <div class="section-label">Go-to-Market</div>
    <h2>80/20: Platform-led with Exchange featured</h2>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;">Eighty percent of our sales and marketing materials lead with the Centime Financial Process Automation platform. Exchange appears as the featured capability that differentiates us &mdash; the reason a buyer picks Centime over Stampli or Tipalti. It gets a named section in every deck, a dedicated page on the website, and a clear explanation of why starting before the first invoice matters.</p>
    <p class="body" style="margin-bottom: 0.8em;">Twenty percent of materials are Exchange-standalone. These target a specific use case: companies that aren't ready for the full platform but need to solve supplier onboarding and verification now. The standalone materials are designed to land the account and create the conditions for a platform upsell within twelve months.</p>
    <p class="body">Internally, the sales team gets competitive battle cards against PaymentWorks and Trustpair. These are not customer-facing. They exist so our reps can handle objections when a prospect says "we're also looking at a dedicated supplier management tool." The answer is always: we do everything they do, and we do everything that comes after.</p>
